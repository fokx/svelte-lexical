import {Steps} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import {FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can get started by using one of the demo projects or following the quick start to add `svelte-lexical` to your existing project.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. To add `svelte-lexical` to your project, run the following command:

   ```bash
   pnpm add svelte-lexical
   ```

2. Import the `RichTextComposer` component in your Svelte component or page:

   ```svelte {3}
   // +page.svelte
   <script>
     import {RichTextComposer} from 'svelte-lexical';
   </script>
   ```

3. Import the default theme in your Svelte component or page:

   ```svelte {4}
   // +page.svelte
   <script>
     import {RichTextComposer} from 'svelte-lexical';
     import {theme} from 'svelte-lexical/dist/themes/default';
   </script>
   ```

4. Use the `RichTextComposer` component in your Svelte component or page:

   ```svelte {7}
   // +page.svelte
   <script>
     import {RichTextComposer} from 'svelte-lexical';
     import {theme} from 'svelte-lexical/dist/themes/default';
   </script>

   <RichTextComposer {theme} />
   ```

5. Add the icons used by the toolbar and dialogs in your application:

   Copy the [icons](https://github.com/umaranis/svelte-lexical/tree/master/packages/svelte-lexical/static/images/icons) folder from the `svelte-lexical` package to your project's `static/images` folder.

   Your folder structure should look like this:

   <FileTree>
   - svelte.config.js
   - package.json
   - src
   - static
     - images
       - **icons**
         - arrow-clockwise.svg
         - add-sign.svg
         - bold.svg
         - camera.svg
         - ...
   </FileTree>

   :::caution
   The `static` folder could also be called `public` depending on your project's configuration.
   :::

   :::note
   You can download the icons using command line by running the below command from project root.

   ```bash
   curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/umaranis/svelte-lexical/contents/packages/svelte-lexical/static/images/icons \
    | grep 'download_url' | cut -d '"' -f 4 | xargs -I {} wget -P static/images/icons {}
    ```
