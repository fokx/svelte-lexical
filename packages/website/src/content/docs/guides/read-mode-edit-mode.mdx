description: How to set Read and Edit mode for the editor
---


## Set the current mode

To get the reference to the editor, see [Get Editor reference](get-reference-to-editor).

You can change the mode as follows:

```js
editor.setEditable(true);
```

## Retrieve the current mode

In order to find the current mode of the editor you can use:

```js
const isEditable = editor.isEditable(); // Returns true or false
```

You can also get notified when the editor's read only mode has changed:

```js
const removeEditableListener = editor.registerEditableListener(
  (isEditable) => {
    // The editor's mode is passed in!
    console.log(isEditable);
  },
);

// Do not forget to unregister the listener when no longer needed!
removeEditableListener();
```

## Launch in Read mode

To launch the editor in Read mode, set the `editable` flag in the `initialConfig`.

```svelte {5}
	const initialConfig = {
		theme: theme,
		namespace: 'pg_demo',
		nodes: [HorizontalRuleNode],
    editable: false,
		onError: (error: Error) => {
			throw error;
		}
	};
```
