import {FileTree} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A theme consists of two parts:
- **editor theme** - styles for the editor content like heading, paragraph, table, etc.
- **shell theme** - styles for the editor shell like toolbar, dialog, etc.

To understand how a custom theme is created, you can refer to the [playground](https://svelte-lexical-playground.vercel.app/) and the [source code](https://github.com/umaranis/svelte-lexical/tree/master/demos/playground) for the same.

Following files in the `playground` project define the custom theme:

<FileTree>
  - svelte.config.js
  - package.json
  - src
    - **index.css** shell theme
    - themes
      - **PlaygroundEditorTheme.css** editor theme styles
      - **PlaygroundEditorTheme.ts** editor theme class names mapping
  - static
</FileTree>
