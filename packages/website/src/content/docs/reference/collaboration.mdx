description: How to enable collaboration in the editor.

Collaboration is implemented using `Yjs` with `y-websocket` as the Connection provider.

## Starting collaboration in the playground

There are two ways to start collaboration in the playground app.

### Cross-tab communication (testing and development)

It works across tabs of a browser (no need to start a `y-websocket` server). Just start the playground app and turn on collaboration.

Svelte-lexical has a Split view that prvides a easier way to work with collaboration.

To start, add the following to the URL: `/split/?isCollab=true`

Or turn on, Split `Split Screen` and `Collaboration` from settings UI.

### Start a collaboration server

1. Start the playground app (run `pnpm dev` from the `/demos/playground` folder)
2. Start the y-websocket server on localhost (run from `/demos/playground` folder)

    `PORT=1234 pnpm y-websocket-server`

3. Turn on `Collaboration` from settings in UI (or pass `?isCollab=true` in the URL)

## Properly boostrapping CollaborationPlugin

- set editor's `initialEditorState` to null
- don't use the HistoryPlugin with collaboration
- resolve path for Yjs in vite config

## Yjs Synchronization issue with vite build in development mode [resolved]

Issue: **Yjs was already imported. This breaks constructor checks and will lead to issues!** (https://github.com/yjs/yjs/issues/438)
